# Botkit Middleware Dialogflow <!-- omit in toc -->

A middleware plugin for [Botkit](http://howdy.ai/botkit) that allows developers to integrate with [Google Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/), leveraging the power of both to build chatbot applications on Node for social platforms like Slack, Facebook and Twilio.

Dialogflow's Natural Language Processing (NLP) platform transforms real-world user input into structured
**intents** and **entities**, and can optionally trigger **actions** and **fulfillment** (webhooks). Configuration
and training are done in the convenient and powerful [Dialogflow Console](https://console.dialogflow.com/), with
the results being immediately available to your bot.

## Installation

```bash
npm install botkit-middleware-dialogflow
```

## Migrating from earlier versions
Dialogflow has two versions of their API. V2 is the standard, and should be the default for new agents.

However, if you need to [migrate](https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/v1-v2-migration-guide) from Dialogflow API V1, or are upgrading from earlier versions of `botkit-middleware-dialogflow`, consider the following factors:
-  some Botkit `message` properties have changed.
    -  `fulfillment.speech` -> `fulfillment.text`
    -   `action` property is new
    -   `nlpResponse` object structure has changed significantly.
-  V2 users must provide a JSON keyfile instead of an API key for DialogFlow authentication
-  options parameter `minimum_confidence` has been renamed `minimumConfidence` to match the predominant style.

`botkit-middleware-dialogflow` continues to support both versions of the API. Instructions for legacy V1 are [below]((#legacy-v1-api)).

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup an Agent in Dialogflow
<img src="images/default_intent.png" />

Google describes `Agents` as *NLU (Natural Language Understanding) modules*. They transform natural user requests into structured, actionable data.

1. In the [Dialogflow Console](https://console.dialogflow.com/), create an [agent](https://dialogflow.com/docs/agents)
2. Choose or create a [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project](https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview/#projects).
3. Dialogflow will automatically setup a `Default Welcome Intent`, which you can try from the test console.

### 2. Create a service account
<img src="images/save_json.png" />

In order for your Bot to access your Dialogflow Agent, you will need to create a `service account`. A [Service account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts) is an identity that allows your bot to access the Dialogflow services on your behalf. Once configured, you can download the private key for your service account as a JSON file.

1. Open the [GCP Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com), and select the project which contains your agent.
2. From the `nav` menu, choose `IAM & admin`, `Service accounts`.
3. Select `Dialogflow Integrations` (created by default by Dialogflow), or create your own.
4. Under `actions`, select `create key`, select `JSON` and download the file.

### 3. Add the middleware to your Bot
Using Slack (as an example), wire up your Bot to listen for the `Default Welcome Intent`, and then pass along the reply that Dialogflow recommends in `fulfillment.text`.

``` javascript
const Botkit = require('botkit');
const dialogflowMiddleware = require('botkit-middleware-dialogflow')({
  keyFilename: './mybot-service-key.json',  // service account private key file from Google Cloud Console
});

const slackController = Botkit.slackbot();
const slackBot = slackController.spawn({
  token: 'xoxb-082028214871-xEEQbIkyAHH3poFMpUG3dkGW',  // Slack API Token
});

slackController.middleware.receive.use(dialogflowMiddleware.receive);
slackBot.startRTM();

slackController.hears(['Default Welcome Intent'], 'direct_message', dialogflowMiddleware.hears, function(
  bot,
  message
) {
  replyText = message.fulfillment.text;  // message object has new fields added by Dialogflow
  bot.reply(message, replyText);
});
```

### 4. Try it out!

## Middleware functions
`Botkit` supports middleware integration into core bot processes in a few useful places, described [here](https://botkit.ai/docs/middleware.html).

### receive()
Each time the chat platform (eg. Slack, Facebook etc) emits a message to Botkit, `botkit-middleware-dialogflow` uses `receive` middleware to process that message and optionally modify it, before passing it back to Botkit and on down the chain.

#### Setup
First, create an instance of the middleware:

```javascript
const dialogflowMiddleware = require('botkit-middleware-dialogflow')(options);
```

Typically `keyFilename` is the only property of `options` that needs to be set. See [options](#options) section for full list.

Next, tell the `controller` that you want to use the middleware:

```javascript
slackController.middleware.receive.use(dialogflowMiddleware.receive);
```

#### ignoreType
Not every message should be sent to DialogFlow, such as `user_typing` indicators. To avoid these uneccessary calls, `botkit-middleware-dialogflow` allows you to specify which message types to ignore, using the `ignoreType` option.

Since the middleware is part of the [message pipeline](https://botkit.ai/docs/readme-pipeline.html), Botkit has already ingested, normalized and categorized the message by the time we apply this filter. Keep this in mind when choosing which types to ignore.

#### API Call
Assuming the message has passed the `ignoreType` filter, it's sent off to the Dialogflow API for processing. The response is parsed and applied to the `message` object itself.

Specifically, here are the new `message` properties available after processing:

*   `message.intent` [intents](https://dialogflow.com/docs/intents) recognized by Dialogflow (eg. saying 'hi' might trigger the `hello-intent`)
*   `message.entities` [entities](https://dialogflow.com/docs/entities) found as defined in Dialogflow (eg. dates, places, etc)
*   `message.action` [actions and parameters](https://dialogflow.com/docs/actions-and-parameters) triggered by the intent
*   `message.fulfillment` [fulfillment](https://dialogflow.com/docs/fulfillment) triggered by the intent, such as webhooks or text responses.
*   `message.confidence` intent detection confidence. Values range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain).
*   `message.nlpResponse` the raw Dialogflow API response.

Here is a diff of a message object, before and after middleware processing.

<img src="images/message_diff.png" />


### hears()
To make your bot listen for the intent name configured in Dialogflow, we need to change the way Botkit "hears" triggers, by passing our middleware into the `hears()` event handler.

For example, using our `dialogflowMiddleware` object defined above:

``` javascript
controller.hears('hello-intent', 'direct_message', dialogflowMiddleware.hears, function(bot, message) {
    // do something
});
```

Notice we are listening for `hello-intent` - that's the name we gave the intent in the [Dialogflow Console](https://console.dialogflow.com/).

Patterns used to match the intent name can be provided as comma seperated strings, regex, or an array of strings and regex.

- `'hello-intent'` // matches hello-intent, HELLO-INTENT case insensitive
- `['hello-intent', /^HELLO.*/i]` // matches hello-intent, hello, or HELLotherejimmy
- `'hello-intent,greeting-intent'` // matches hello-intent or greeting-intent'

Patterns are compared with the `message.intent` property after the `receives()` function has processed it.

### action()
When an intent is triggered, a Dialogflow agent can be configured to take an [action](https://dialogflow.com/docs/actions-and-parameters). The name of the action is captured in the `message.action` property, after procesing by the middleware.

You can setup a `hears()` event handler to trigger on `message.action` as well.

``` javascript
controller.hears('hello-intent', 'direct_message', dialogflowMiddleware.action, function(bot, message) {
    // do something
});
```

The patterns format is the same as `hears()`.


## Options

When creating the middleware object, pass an options object with the following parameters.

| Property          | Required      | Default                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| ignoreType        | No            | 'self_message'                         | Skip Dialogflow processing if the `type` matches the pattern. Useful to avoid unneccessary API calls. Patterns can be provided as a string, regex, or array of either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| minimumConfidence | No            | 0.0                                    | Dialogflow returns a confidence (in the range 0.0 to 1.0) for each matching intent. This value is the cutoff - the `hears` and `action` middleware will only return a match for confidence values equal or greather than this value.                                                                                                                                                          |
| sessionIdProps    | No            | ['user', 'channel']                    | Session ID's help Dialogflow preserve context across multiple calls. By default, this session ID is an MD5 hash of the `user` and `channel` properties on the `message` object. If you'd like to use different properties, provide them as a string or array of strings. If none of the desired properties are available on a `message`, the middleware will use a random session ID instead. |
| lang              | No            | 'en'                                   | if the `message` object does not have a `lang` property, this language will be used as the default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

> v2 users can optionally provide a path to a .pem or .p12 `keyFilename`, in which case you must specify an `email` and `projectId` parameter as well.

## Language Support

Dialogflow supports [multi-language agents](https://dialogflow.com/docs/multi-language). If the `message` object has a `lang` value set,
the middleware will send it to Dialogflow and the response will be in that language, if the agent supports it.

By default, Botkit `message` objects do not have a langauge specified, so Dialogflow defaults to `en`.

For example, to invoke the Dialogflow agent in French, set your `message` as such:

```javascript
message.lang = 'fr';
```

## Debugging

To enable debug logging, specify `dialogflow-middleware` in the `DEBUG` environment variable, like this:

```bash
DEBUG=dialogflow-middleware node your_awesome_bot.js
```

By default, objects are only logged to a depth of 2. To recurse indefinitely, set `DEBUG_DEPTH` to `null`, like this:

```bash
DEBUG=dialogflow-middleware DEBUG_DEPTH=null node your_awesome_bot.js
```

## Legacy V1 API
To use the legacy V1 version of the Dialogflow API:

- In the Dialogflow console:
    - In the agent settings, select `V1 API`.
    - Note the `Client access token`.
- Set options for the middleware:
    - `token` is the `Client access token` from the Dialogflow console.
    - `version` should be set to `v1`, telling `botkit-middleware-dialogflow` to use the legacy API.
